## Overview 
Our company wants to determine the likelihood a customer would discontinue their subscription to the services we provide.
Using a dataset containing information collected from each customer a model that predicts the pattern was developed giving insights into the behaviour of current and potential customers.

## Data Understanding
The dataset (bigml_59c28831336c6604c800002a.csv) contains a subset of over 3000 entries with information on our clientele. Containing:
* The State and Area code of users
* The account age of users
* Additional services they may have opted for
* Their total usage in minutes and calls
* And, how frequently they had called customer services

## Data Analysis
Logistic Regression was used to discern the customer churn rate (likelihood to lose a customer).
It was found that considering the account age, total usage and additional plans, were the most useful in predicting the churn rate
